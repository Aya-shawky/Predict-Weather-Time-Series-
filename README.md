# Predict-Weather-Time-Series
In this project weather was predicted using 2 different techniques ARIMA model and LSTM.

## Main Steps
1. Analysis Data to understand it 
2. ADF Test to identify data is stationary or not
- Humidity -> stationary Data
- Tempreture -> non-stationary Data
3. Predict Humidity 
4. Transforming non-stationary data to stationary
5. Predict Tempreture 

## Appendix

DataSet: daily-climate-time-series-data

This data contains climate information from 2013 to 2017 in indian have 4 features:
- Tempreture
- Humadity
- Wind speed
- Presure
  
dataset = 1461 sample
